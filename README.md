# Alarm-Clock-in-python
This is an interesting Command Line Interface (CLI) Python application for an intermediate-level developer. People across the globe use alarm clock features in their devices but this project can be altered in a bit different manner. Some certain YouTube links can be added to a text file and the project is programmed in a way that when a user sets an alarm then the code shall pick a random link from the video and will start playing the YouTube link.
